# DynamicSelector

A cross-platform parametric filtering system with external UI and Unity integration.

## Vision

DynamicSelector aims to become a flexible and engine-independent editor to configure, filter, and visualize parametric datasets — starting with Unity, but built for expansion.

## Features

- Standalone `.exe` interface for filter configuration
- Unity integration via dynamic .dll
- Data-driven via XML/JSON feeds
- Modular, scalable, and future-proof architecture

## Structure

- `src/` – application source code
- `tests/` – unit/integration tests
- `docs/` – architectural documents and specs
- `.github/` – CI/CD workflows
